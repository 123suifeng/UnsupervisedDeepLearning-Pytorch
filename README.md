# Unsupervised Deep Learning with Pytorch

This repository tries to provide unsupervised deep learning models with Pytorch for convenient use.

## Convolutional VAE
VAE using convolutional and deconvolutional networks is demonstrated with SVHN dataset. Expample code is ``test_convvae.py". The reconstruction and samples generated is show as follows:
